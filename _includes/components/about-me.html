        Hello! I've been working as a professional programmer since 2021. I started my
        journey as a Flutter developer and later transitioned to Laravel.
        Currently, I specialize in web development, covering everything from
        CI/CD to front-end and back-end development. I am experienced in PHP,
        but I also enjoy exploring other programming languages such as Java,
        Kotlin, Rust, Ruby, and more.
